# move2pg   
I want to do something in the 7 days before my expected date of confinement, so I thought of **move2pg**.

* It's aim to transfer DDL and data from Other DB(only **Oracle** is supported now) to **PostgreSQL**; 
* It's a **cross-platform GUI tool** write in **Java**, supports all OS only need JDK installed.

Code commit or bug report are all welcomed. Thanks and Regards!

Liu, Yuanyuan :)
