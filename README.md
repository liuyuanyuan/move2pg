# move2pg   
I want to do something in the 7 days before my expected date of confinement, so I thought of **orcl2pg**.

* It's aim to transfer DDL and data from Other DB(now only support Oracle) to PostgreSQL; 
* It's a cross-platform GUI tool write in Java, supports all OS only need JDK installed.

Code commit or bug report are all welcomed. Thanks and Regards!
