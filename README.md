# orcl2pg   
I want to do something in the 7 days before my expected date of confinement, so I thought of orcl2pg.

* It's to transfer DDL and data from Oracle to PostgreSQL; 
* I's a cross-platform GUI tool write in Java, supports all OS only need JDK installed.

Code commit or bug report are all welcomed. Thanks and Regards!
